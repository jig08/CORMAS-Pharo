For several years now, simulation platforms have been used by different communities of researchers (in the natural sciences and social sciences) to facilitate the design and implementation of multi-agent models, as well as Analysis of simulation experiments.

Specialized in the field of renewable natural resources management, the multi-agent simulation software we have developed, Cormas, is a tool for representing the interactions between actors about renewable natural resources.

Cormas is a simulation platform based on the VisualWorks programming environment that enables the development of applications using the SmallTalk object-oriented programming language. Cormas predefined entities are generic SmallTalk classes from which, by specialization and refinement, users can create the entities specific to their model.
