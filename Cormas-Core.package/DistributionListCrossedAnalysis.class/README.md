DistributionListCrossedAnalysis allows to conduct Crossed sensitivity analysis by modifying parameters' values simultaneously.
Each studied parameter may be analysed by changing its initial value for each simulation run. Distribution List means that this parameter will change its value from a given List defined by user.
