SequentialOAT allows to conduct OAT ("One-Factor-At-A-Time") sensitivity analysis by modifying parameters' values. It means that the parameter sets are not crossed during analysis. 
Each studied parameter may be analysed by changing its initial value for each simulation run. Sequential means that this parameter will change its value from an InitialValue to a FinalValue by Increment (or step).
